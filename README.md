# Hi, I’m Błażej 👋

**Game Developer → SysAdmin → Aspiring DevOps Engineer**


## ☺️ About Me

🌞 By day, I work with infrastructure — as a network administrator and helpdesk specialist, solving real-world IT challenges and keeping systems reliable.  
🌜 By night, I dive into game development — coding gameplay systems, experimenting with engines, and building indie projects for fun.  

⚙️ Across both worlds, one theme drives me: **automation**.  
I enjoy making things run on their own — from deployment pipelines and server scripts to smart-home routines.  
Even the games I love, like *Factorio*, are all about efficiency and automated systems.  

☁️ That’s why I’m pursuing a path in **DevOps**: it connects my professional skills with my personal passions, allowing me to build, automate, and improve every step of the process.

## 🔮 What’s Next?

To strengthen my DevOps profile, I plan to add:  
- **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions with automated builds & tests)  
- **Containerized environments** (Docker + Kubernetes demos)  
- **Infrastructure automation** (Terraform + cloud deployment examples)  
- **Monitoring & logging tools** (Prometheus, Grafana, Zabbix)
