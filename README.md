# Hi, I‚Äôm B≈Ça≈ºej üëã

**SysAdmin by day üåû Indie Game Dev by night üåú**


## ‚ò∫Ô∏è About Me

‚öôÔ∏è Across both worlds, one theme drives me: **automation**.  
I enjoy making things run on their own ‚Äî from deployment pipelines and server scripts to smart-home routines.  
Even the games I love, like *Factorio*, are all about efficiency and automated systems.  

‚òÅÔ∏è That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm pursuing a path in **DevOps**.
