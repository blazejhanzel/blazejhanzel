# Hi, I’m Błażej 👋

**Game Developer → SysAdmin → Aspiring DevOps Engineer**


## ☺️ About Me

🌞 By day, I work with infrastructure — as a network administrator and helpdesk specialist, solving real-world IT challenges and keeping systems reliable.  
🌜 By night, I dive into game development — coding gameplay systems, experimenting with engines, and building indie projects for fun.  

⚙️ Across both worlds, one theme drives me: **automation**.  
I enjoy making things run on their own — from deployment pipelines and server scripts to smart-home routines.  
Even the games I love, like *Factorio*, are all about efficiency and automated systems.  

☁️ That’s why I’m pursuing a path in **DevOps**: it connects my professional skills with my personal passions, allowing me to build, automate, and improve every step of the process.

![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-339933?logo=node.js&logoColor=white)
![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-47A248?logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)

A multi-platform web application concept designed to help writers and game developers create **logically consistent story universes**.  

- **Academic Context**: Engineering thesis project (prototype stage, not publicly released)  
- **Core Idea**: Manage characters, events, and locations in shared story universes, ensuring logical consistency between narrative elements  
- **Collaboration Features**: Multi-user support with role management (admin + contributors)  
- **Tech Stack**: React frontend, Node.js backend, MongoDB for data storage  

> 📖 Inspired by challenges in **non-linear storytelling** (games, novels, open-world narratives), the project aimed to provide a tool to avoid plot inconsistencies and streamline collaborative worldbuilding.

![Blender](https://img.shields.io/badge/Blender-F5792A?logo=blender&logoColor=white)

An early 3D adventure project exploring Unity and custom asset creation. Most of the original project hasn’t survived, but it was my first attempt at building 3D gameplay systems.  

- **Focus**: Experimented with gameplay mechanics and custom 3D assets 
- **Year**: 2020 – my last project before adopting Git; since then, version control has become a core part of my workflow  
- **Documentation**: [Screenshots](screenshots/pixman/README.md)

## 🔮 What’s Next?

To strengthen my DevOps profile, I plan to add:  
- **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions with automated builds & tests)  
- **Containerized environments** (Docker + Kubernetes demos)  
- **Infrastructure automation** (Terraform + cloud deployment examples)  
- **Monitoring & logging tools** (Prometheus, Grafana, Zabbix)
