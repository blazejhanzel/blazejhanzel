# 🔧 DevOps Portfolio

Welcome to my DevOps portfolio! 👋

Here you’ll find a showcase of my journey into automation, cloud infrastructure, and modern deployment practices.  
I’m passionate about building reliable, scalable systems and streamlining development workflows.


## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Bitbucket Pipelines 
- **Containers:** Docker  
- **Cloud:** GitHub Pages, OVH Cloud


## 🔀 CI/CD Projects

### Deployment with GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages

My first experience with CI/CD was on Bitbucket, and I immediately loved the automation possibilities.  
Now, I use GitHub Actions to run tests before merging, automate builds for private cross-platform projects, and deploy static sites with GitHub Pages.

Here’s an example project:

## 🚢 Docker Projects

### Personal & Server Containers

Docker has become an essential part of my workflow, both for development and deployment.  
I use Docker to test applications locally on my PC, host public demos on my servers, and run private services for myself and my family.

Here’s a repository with the Docker Compose setups I use for personal projects and home automation:
